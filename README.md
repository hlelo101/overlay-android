# Android overlay
Just read the repo description!

# Will it work on any device?
I doubt it will. It has been made to work on a Pixel 3, but it may not work with phones with a different screen resolution or calculator.\
It will only work with `com.google.android.calculator`.

# How can I use it?
Just start the app. Once in the app, click on the first two buttons. One is to allow the application to use overlays, the other one is to allow the accessibility service to run.\
**NOTE:** You might need to restart the accessibility service to make it work correctly. By that I mean start it, then stop it, then start it again. You can start it by enabling the service and stop it by disabling it.\
Then, just launch Google's calculator and try to press on the equal button!
